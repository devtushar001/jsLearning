JavaScript Modules

--> As our program grows bigger, it may contain many lines of code. Instead of putting everything in a single file, you can use modules to separate codes in separate files according to their functions. This makes our code organized and easier to maintain. Benefits of Using Modules:

--> The code base is easier to maintain because different codes having different functionalitees are in different files.

--> Makes code reusable. You can define a module and use it numerous times as per your needs.
