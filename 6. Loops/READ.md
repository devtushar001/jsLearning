JavaScript for loop

In programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code. For example, if you want to show a message 100 times, then you can use a loop The syntax of the for loop is:

for (initialExpression; condition; updateExpression) {
//for loop body
}

JavaScript while loop

The syntax of the while loop is:

while (condition) {
// body of loop
//increment step
}

for vs while loop

A for loop is usually used when the number of iterations is known. And while and do...while loops are usually used when the number of iterations are unknown.

JavaScript do-while loop

The syntax of do..while loop is:

do {
// body of loop
} while (condition)

Note: do...while loop is similar to the while loop. The only difference is that in do..while loop, the body of loop is executed at least once.

continue and break

The break statement is used to terminate the loop immediately when it si encountered.

The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and the control flow of the program goes to the next iteration.
