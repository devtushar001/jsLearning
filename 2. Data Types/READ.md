JavaScript Type Conversion

--> Important Notes

1. JavaScript considers 0 as false and all non-zero numbers as true. And, if true is converted to a number, the result is always 1.

2. String() takes null and undefined and converts the to string.

3. In JavaScript, undefined, null 0, NaN, "", converts to false. All other values give true.
