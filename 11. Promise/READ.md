Promises Basics

In JavaScript, a promise is a good way to handle asynchronous operations. It is used to find out if the asynchronous operation is successfully completed or not.
A promise may have one of three states.

--> Pending
--> Fulfilled
--> Rejected

Using a Promise

--> The then() method
The then() method is used with the callback when the promise is successfully fulfilled or resolved.

--> The catch() method
The catch() method is used with the callback when the promise is rejected or if an error occurs.

--> The finally() method
The finally() method gets executed when the promise is either resolved successfully or rejected.
