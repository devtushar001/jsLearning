If-else statement

In computer programming, there may arise situations where you have to run a block of code among more than one alternatives.

if(condition) {
//block of code if condition is true
} else {
//block of code if condtion is false
}

Nested if-else statement

--> You can also use an if..else statement inside of an if else statement. This is known as nested if...else statement.

if (condition2) {
if (condition2) {
//code to run
} else {
// code if condition is false
}
} else {
// block of code if condtion is false
}

Ternary Operator
--> A ternary operator evaluates a condition and executes a block of code base on the condition.

condition ? expression1: expression2

The ternary operator evaluates the test condtion.
--> if the condition is true, expression1 is executed.

--> if the condition is false, expression2 is executed.
