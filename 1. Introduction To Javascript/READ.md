JavaScript

JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updated content, control multimedia, animate images, and much more.

In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script>and </script> tags

--> e.g.

<script> 
  const x = 12;
</script>

Variables in JavaScript

Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values). We can declare a variable by using these keywords.

--> Using let for declaring block-scoped variables (new)
--> Using const for declaring constants variables

Rules for writing variable name
--> Variable names must start with either a letter, an undersore\_, or the doller sign $

--> Variable names cannot start with numbers.

--> JavaScript is case-sensetive.

--> Keywords cannot be used as variable names.
